# What is this repository?

As you might have realised MailFace is not a real product. This repository is an example repository that tries to show how to write a good copy for an SDK on Github.

## Goals

The goal of repo documentation is:

* For a developer to install and initialize the SDK library
* For a developer to make their first SDK/API call
* For a developer to know where to find their API credentials
* For a developer to know where to get support
* For a developer to know where to find further documentation

The goal of repo documentation is __not__:

* To be the main source for documentation on the API and SDKs. For full documentation the user should be sent to the docs on the main developer documentation portal
* To document API arguments and response codes. Again, this is what the developer documentation on the docs site is for,

## Content

The parts that make up good copy for a repository are (from top to bottom):

### In the repo header

* A short and descriptive repo title
* A link to the docs for this language in the title

### In the README

* A short and descriptive title
* A badge showing the current library version
* A badge showing the current build status of the master branch
* A link (badge or regular) to support channels
* A short descrition of what the product does.
* A link to the product's homepage and language specific docs.
* An __Installation__ section
  * Which shows how to install the library
  * Which lists any requirements on the language or platform
  * Which then links out to the official docs to continue
* A __Get Started__ section
  * That instructs a user where to register and get their API credentials (and potentially set up their first app)
  * That shows a code sample that demonstrates how to initialize the library
  * That shows a code sample that demonstrates how to make a first SDK call with the library
  * Which then links out to the official docs to continue
* An __Initialization__ section
  * That shows an overview of the different ways the library can be initialised
  * That reminds the user where to get their API credentials or sign up
  * Which then links out to the official docs to continue
* A __Documentation__ section
